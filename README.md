# AI-Projects-2025
This repo is a display of the AI programs I have studied and implemented in different eviroments.
NOTE: A python notebook is required to run all instances of code provided

1. Soduku Solver
-To run this program download SodukuSolver.ipynb and the Puzzles folder
-At the top of the program there will be an ALGORITHM parameter that can be used to change which algo will be ran
-Output will be saved as a .txt file

2. Wumpus World
-NOT UPLOADED

3. Bayesian Network Probabilty Calulator
-NOT UPLOADED

4. Racetrack Simulator
-To run this program download RaceTrack.ipynb and the Tracks folder
-At the top of the program there will be an ALGORITHM parameter that can be used to change which algo will be ran
-Also in parameters is the CRASH_POS var which determines the rules implemented when the car crashes in the simulation
  -'STRT' - the car will restart at the start line after crashing
  -'NRST' - the car will restart at the nearest point on the road from the crash point.
